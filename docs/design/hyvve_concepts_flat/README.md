# HYVVE - Flat Logo Concepts

**Generated:** 2025-11-30
**Status:** Flat/Minimalist Exploration

This document presents the flat, vector-style adaptations of the HYVVE logo concepts. These designs focus on clean lines, solid colors, and scalability, removing the 3D rendering and lighting effects.

## Concept 1: The Geometric Hexagon
**Keywords:** Minimalist, Layered, Clean

A flat hexagonal structure composed of nested vector outlines. The core is a solid bright coral, with surrounding layers in flat bands of coral and teal.

## Concept 2: The Flat Double-V
**Keywords:** Flow, Gradient, Vector

A stylized infinity loop formed by two interlocking 'V' shapes with a solid gradient fill. No metallic effects or shadows, just pure form.

## Concept 3: The Flat Energy Hive
**Keywords:** Symbol, concentric, Icon

A central solid white-coral circle with concentric hexagonal rings expanding outward in flat vector colors.

## Concept 4: The Neural Hexagon (Description)
*Note: Image generation for this concept was skipped due to system limits.*

A flat hexagon outline containing a clean network of nodes and lines representing a neural net. 6 distinct colored dots (Coral, Teal, Orange, Green, Pink, Blue) connected by thin grey lines in a circuit board aesthetic.
