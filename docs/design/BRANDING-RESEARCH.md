## 6. Logo Design Principles

### The 5 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Simplicity** | Bold and simple > intricate detail |
| **Scalability** | Works at any size (favicon to billboard) |
| **Memorability** | Unique shapes, clever negative space |
| **Timelessness** | Modern ≠ trendy |
| **Versatility** | Works in black/white first |

### Modern Tech Logo Trends

**Avoid:** Swirling geometric symbols, hexagons, generic abstract shapes

**Instead:** Aim for timelessness, not trendiness

### Logo Best Practices

4. **Design variants** - Full logo, wordmark, icon
5. **Test at small sizes** - Must work as app icon

### Logo Anatomy for AI Business Hub

Consider:
- **Wordmark** - "AI Business Hub" or abbreviated
- **Monogram** - "ABH" or "Hub"
- **Symbol** - Abstract representation of AI + business
- **Combined** - Symbol + wordmark lockup

## 10. Dark Mode Branding

### Why Dark Mode Matters

- Users increasingly prefer dark mode
- Reduces eye strain
- Saves battery on OLED screens
- Premium, modern perception

### Color Adaptation Principles

| Light Mode | Dark Mode Adaptation |
|------------|---------------------|
| Pure white (#FFFFFF) | Off-white (#FAFAF9) or light gray (#D3D3D3) |
| Pure black (#000000) | Dark gray (#1A1A1D) |
| Saturated colors | Slightly desaturated versions |
| Multiple bright colors | Single accent color |

### Brand Color in Dark Mode

> "Use saturated primary color on 1-2 elements (button, logo), desaturated version for the rest."

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Keep logo colors consistent (if possible)
2. Add slight tint to backgrounds (blue, purple, or green undertone)
3. Reduce saturation of accent colors
4. Increase contrast for readability

### Dark Mode Palette Strategy

```css
/* Background variations */
--bg-base: #09090b;        /* Near-black with slight warmth */
--bg-elevated: #18181b;    /* Cards, panels */
--bg-hover: #27272a;       /* Interactive states */

/* Text variations */
--text-primary: #fafafa;   /* Main content */
--text-secondary: #a1a1aa; /* Supporting */
--text-muted: #71717a;     /* Subtle hints */

/* Brand accent (example: purple) */
--accent-light: #a78bfa;   /* Light mode: #8b5cf6 - desaturated for dark */
```

### Emotional Considerations

> "Think of how your UI would behave as a 'night owl' rather than a 'morning person'—more modern, mysterious, serious, and exclusive."
