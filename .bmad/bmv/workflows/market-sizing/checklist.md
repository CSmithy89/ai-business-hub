- [ ] All sources from current year or within 24 months

### Source Quality and Credibility

- [ ] Paywalled reports properly attributed
- [ ] Primary sources prioritized over secondary

### Multi-Source Verification

- [ ] TAM verified by 2+ independent sources
- [ ] Growth rates corroborated by multiple analysts
- [ ] Where sources conflict, ALL estimates presented
- [ ] Variance between sources explained

### Confidence Level Marking

- [ ] High confidence claims marked (2+ sources agree)
- [ ] Medium confidence claims flagged (single source)
- [ ] Low confidence/estimated claims clearly labeled
- [ ] Speculative data marked as PROJECTION

## TAM Calculation
