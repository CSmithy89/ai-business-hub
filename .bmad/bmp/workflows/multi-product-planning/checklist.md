## Anti-Hallucination Reminders

- All financial projections must be grounded in documented assumptions
- Growth rates must be justified with market data or benchmarks
- Cost estimates should use industry standards where specific data unavailable
- Flag any estimates that lack supporting evidence
- When uncertain, use conservative estimates
