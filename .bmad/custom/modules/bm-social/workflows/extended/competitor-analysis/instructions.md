### Step 5: Analyze Content Strategy
Break down competitor content:

```
CONTENT STRATEGY ANALYSIS

@competitor_a Content Mix:
--------------------------
Educational:    ████████░░ 42%
Promotional:    ████░░░░░░ 23%
Engagement:     ███░░░░░░░ 18%
News/Updates:   ██░░░░░░░░ 12%
Behind-scenes:  █░░░░░░░░░ 5%

Top Performing Content Types:
1. How-to threads (avg 4.5K engagements)
2. Industry statistics (avg 3.2K engagements)
3. Customer stories (avg 2.8K engagements)

Posting Schedule:
Mon-Fri: 8 AM, 12 PM, 5 PM
Weekends: 10 AM only
Frequency: 3.2 posts/day average

GAPS IN YOUR STRATEGY:
- No customer story content (competitor gets 2.8K/post)
- Lower weekend posting (missing 15% engagement)
```

### Step 6: Hashtag Intelligence
Analyze hashtag strategies:

```
HASHTAG ANALYSIS

COMPETITOR HASHTAG USAGE
------------------------
@competitor_a Top Hashtags:
#ProductivityTips (34 uses, 2.1K avg eng)
#AIForBusiness (28 uses, 1.8K avg eng)
#TechLeadership (22 uses, 1.5K avg eng)

@competitor_b Top Hashtags:
#FutureOfWork (41 uses, 3.2K avg eng)
#RemoteTeams (35 uses, 2.7K avg eng)
#WorkSmarter (29 uses, 2.1K avg eng)

HASHTAG OPPORTUNITIES
---------------------
High-performing hashtags YOU don't use:
1. #FutureOfWork - 3.2K avg (competitor_b)
2. #TechLeadership - 2.4K avg (competitor_a)
3. #StartupLife - 2.1K avg (competitor_c)

Low competition, high relevance:
1. #AIProductivity - Low usage, high relevance
2. #SmartBusiness - Moderate usage, good fit
```

### Step 7: Share of Voice Analysis
Calculate market presence:

```
SHARE OF VOICE

Industry Conversation: "AI Business Tools"
Period: Last 30 days

SHARE OF VOICE BREAKDOWN
------------------------
@competitor_c:  ████████░░ 34%  (Industry leader)
@competitor_a:  █████░░░░░ 22%
Your account:   ████░░░░░░ 18%  ← You are here
@competitor_b:  ███░░░░░░░ 14%
Others:         ███░░░░░░░ 12%

TREND OVER TIME
---------------
Jan → Feb: Your SOV +2.3%
Feb → Mar: Your SOV +1.1%
Projection: On track to overtake competitor_b in 45 days

KEY CONVERSATION DRIVERS
------------------------
- Product announcements drive 40% of mentions
- Thought leadership drives 25%
- Customer advocacy drives 20%
```

### Step 8: Identify Opportunities

```
